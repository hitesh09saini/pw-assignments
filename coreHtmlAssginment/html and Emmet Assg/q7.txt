Nesting in Emmet :-

nesting operators are shorthand symbols used to create nested HTML or XML structures quickly and efficiently. They allow developers to represent parent-child relationships between elements in a concise manner. Nesting operators help simplify the writing of complex code structures with just a few characters, making it easier to understand and manage the code.

The most commonly used nesting operator in Emmet is the > (child) operator. It represents the parent-child relationship between elements. When you use the > operator, the element to the left of the operator becomes the parent, and the element to the right becomes its child.

 For example:-

1.
  ul>li

expands to :-

  <ul>
    <li></li>
  </ul>


2.

div+p+a

expands to 

<div></div>
<p></p>
<a></a>

3.

div>ul>li+li^+li

expands to 

<div>
    <ul>
        <li></li>
        <li></li>
    </ul>
    <li></li>

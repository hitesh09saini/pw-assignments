self-closing tags, also known as void or empty tags, are a specific type of HTML tags that do not require a separate closing tag. They represent elements that do not contain any content or children. In HTML, self-closing tags are denoted by adding a forward slash (/) before the closing angle bracket (>). Self-closing tags are used for elements that are either empty by definition (e.g., <br>) or have attributes that provide all the necessary information (e.g., <img>).

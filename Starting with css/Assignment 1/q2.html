    <h1>About CSS</h1>
   <div class="box">
    CSS, which stands for Cascading Style Sheets, is a fundamental technology used in web development to define the presentation and layout of HTML documents. It is an essential component in creating visually appealing and consistent web pages. With CSS, developers can control the appearance of various elements on a website, such as fonts, colors, margins, padding, and positioning.

    One of the key features of CSS is its cascading nature, where styles are applied hierarchically. This means that you can define general styles for a set of elements and then override or extend those styles for specific elements or classes. This enhances reusability and maintenance, as changes can be applied across the entire website easily.
    
    CSS offers a wide range of selectors that allow developers to target specific elements precisely. Additionally, media queries enable responsive design, making it possible to adapt the layout to different screen sizes and devices.
    
    Over the years, CSS has evolved significantly, and new features have been introduced to address modern web design challenges. CSS pre-processors like Sass and Less extend the language by providing variables, nesting, and other advanced features.
    
    In conclusion, CSS is a crucial tool for web developers to achieve attractive and consistent layouts across various platforms and devices, contributing to a seamless and enjoyable user experience on the web.
